If you `tail -n +2` this file, you won't see this line or the line above.

If you `tail -n -2` this file, it will behave just like `head` or `tail -n 2`

`tail` seems like a strict analogue to `head`, and it can be used in this way.

However, `tail` has one very useful mode that `head` does not: `tail -f`

If you have a log file that is being written to, you can `follow` these writes
with `tail -f` on the log file. `tail` will print the last ten lines of the file
then it will print every subsequent written line to the file.

If you `tail -n 20` this file, you will see the LAST 20 lines, which should
be all the previous text, plus the text down to/up to here. Try `tail -n +2`



(Note that this file is somewhat out of order, since we're assuming that you're
using `tail` to view it.)



Look at `head` first.

If you `tail` this file, you will see the last 10 lines. 
That should be the text down to...
...
...
...
...
...
here. Try `tail -n 20`

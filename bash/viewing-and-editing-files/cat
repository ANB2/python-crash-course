The `cat` command is actually for con-cat-enating files.

It's intended to be used to take multiple files and write the concatenation
of them to a file.

However, when you type `cat file`, the default behaviour is to take the file
you specified and write it to your terminal (to the "standard output" stream.)

Try to `cat` this file multiple times:
$ cat cat cat cat

You should see triple!

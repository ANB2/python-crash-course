`head` is a very useful command that lets you see the `head' of a file: i.e.,
the first ten lines.

`head` this file to see the text down to...
...
...
...
...
...
here. You can control how many lines shown with `head -n`. Try `head -n 20`

This line should have been out of view before. With `head -n 20`, you should
be able to see text down to...
...
...
...
...
...
...
here.  You can also ask to see all but the last n lines. Try `head -n-2`

If used `head -n 2` on this file, you wouldn't see this or the previous blank line.

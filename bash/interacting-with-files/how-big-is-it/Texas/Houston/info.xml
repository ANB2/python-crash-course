Houston was founded in 1836 on land near the banks of [[Buffalo Bayou]], now known as [[Allen's Landing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen's Landing&quot;&gt;{{Handbook of Texas | author=Kleiner, D.J | name=Allen's Landing | id=AA/hvabg| retrieved=2007-06-10|date=2005-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HouHTO&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-01

The city was named after former General [[Sam Houston]], who was president of the [[Republic of Texas]] and had commanded and won at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of where the city was established. The burgeoning port and railroad industry, combined with oil discovery in 1901, has induced continual surges in the city's population. In the mid-twentieth century, Houston became the home of the [[Texas Medical Center]]—the world's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions—and NASA's [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]], where the [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] is located.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Medical Center. (2006).

Rated as a global city, Houston's economy has a broad industrial base in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation.

In August 1836, two real estate entrepreneurs—[[Augustus Chapman Allen]] and [[John Kirby Allen]]—from New&amp;nbsp;York, purchased {{convert|6642|acre|km2}} of land along [[Buffalo Bayou]] with the intent of founding a city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coutinho&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Brief history of Houston|last=Coutinho|first=Juliana|url=http://www.stp.uh.edu/vol66/13/news/news-index.html|work=[[The Daily Cougar]]|date=2000-09-13|accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Allen brothers decided to name the city after [[Sam Houston]], the popular general at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Coutinho&quot;/&gt; who was elected President of Texas in September 1836.

By 1890, Houston was the railroad center of Texas.[[File:Union Station, Houston, Texas.jpg|thumb|Union Station, Houston, Texas (postcard, circa 1911)]]

In 1900, after Galveston was struck by a devastating [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900|hurricane]], efforts to make Houston into a viable deepwater port were accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/governors/rising/sayers-galv.html J.H.W.

When [[United States home front during World  War II|World War II]] started, tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city.

During the late 1970s, Houston experienced a population boom as people from [[Rust Belt]] states moved to Texas in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.texasalmanac.com/culture/groups/polish.html | title=Polish-Texans | work=Texas Almanac 2004–2005 | accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new residents came for the numerous employment opportunities in the petroleum industry, created as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis|Arab Oil Embargo]].

The population boom ended abruptly in the mid-1980s, as oil prices fell precipitously. The space industry also suffered in 1986 after the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle Challenger]] disintegrated shortly after launch. The late 1980s saw a recession adversely affecting the city's economy.

Since the 1990s, as a result of the recession, Houston has made efforts to diversify its economy by focusing on aerospace and health care/biotechnology and by reducing its dependence on the petroleum industry. In 1997, Houstonians elected [[Lee P.

Houston has four major bayous passing through the city. [[Buffalo Bayou]] runs through downtown and the [[Houston Ship Channel]], and has three tributaries: [[White Oak Bayou]], which runs through the Houston&amp;nbsp;Heights community northwest of Downtown and then towards Downtown; Braes&amp;nbsp;Bayou, which runs along the Texas Medical Center; and Sims Bayou, which runs through the south of Houston and downtown Houston. The ship channel continues past Galveston and then into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

=== Geology ===
Underpinning Houston's land surface are [[Consolidation (geology)|unconsolidated]] clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. These [[sediment]]s consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of [[halite]], a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into [[salt dome]] formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hch07 Harris County].

There have been no significant historically recorded earthquakes in Houston, but researchers do not discount the possibility of such quakes having occurred in the deeper past, nor occurring in the future. Land in some areas southeast of Houston is sinking because water has been pumped out of the ground for many years. It may be associated with slip along the faults; however, the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake, where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070715065340/http://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/eq/faq/tx.htm Texas Earthquakes], ''University of Texas Institute for Geophysics'', July 2001.

Houston's climate is classified as [[humid subtropical climate|humid&amp;nbsp;subtropical]] (''Cfa'' in [[Humid temperate climate|Köppen climate classification system]]). While not necessarily part of &quot;[[Tornado Alley]]&quot; like much of the rest of Texas, spring [[Supercell|supercell thunderstorms]] do sometimes bring tornadoes to the area.

=== Cityscape ===
{{Further2|[[Geographic areas of Houston]]|[[List of Houston neighborhoods]]}}
Houston was incorporated in 1837 under the [[Ward (politics)|ward]] system of representation. The ward designation is the progenitor of the eleven current-day geographically-oriented Houston City Council districts. Locations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate&amp;nbsp;610 Loop]]. The inside encompasses the central business district and many residential neighborhoods that predate World War II. More recently, high-density residential areas have been developed within the loop. The city's outlying areas, suburbs and enclaves are located outside of the loop. [[Texas State Highway Beltway 8|Beltway 8]] encircles the city another {{convert|5|mi|km}} farther out.

Though Houston is the largest city in the United States without formal [[zoning]] regulations, it has developed similarly to other [[Sun Belt]] cities because the city's land use regulations and [[Covenant (law)#In a legal context|legal covenants]] have played a similar role.&lt;ref name=nytzoning&gt;{{cite news | title = FOCUS: Houston; A Fresh Approach To Zoning | work=New York Times | accessdate = 2009-03-27 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/17/realestate/focus-houston-a-fresh-approach-to-zoning.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print | first=Robert | last=Reinhold

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regulations include mandatory lot size for single-family houses and requirements that parking be available to tenants and customers. Such restrictions have had mixed results. Though some&lt;ref name=nozoning/&gt; have blamed the city's low density, [[urban sprawl]], and lack of pedestrian-friendliness on these policies, the city's land use has also been credited with having significant affordable housing, sparing Houston the worst effects of the [[United States housing bubble|2008 real estate crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Lack of zoning has paid off for Houston|work=chron.com, Houston Chronicle|date= 2008-05-27|accessdate=2009-03-27|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/steffy/5804649.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city issued 42,697 building permits in 2008 and was ranked first in the list of healthiest housing markets for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Healthiest Housing Markets for 2009 - Local Markets, Construction, Home Priceses | work=Builder Magazine | date = 2009-02-27 | accessdate = 2009-03-04 | url = http://www.builderonline.com/local-markets/the-healthiest-housing-markets-for-2009.aspx?page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voters rejected efforts to have separate residential and commercial land-use districts in 1948, 1962, and 1993. Consequently, rather than a single central business district as the center of the city's employment, multiple districts have grown throughout the city in addition to [[Downtown Houston|downtown]] which include [[Uptown Houston|Uptown]], [[Texas Medical Center|Texas&amp;nbsp;Medical&amp;nbsp;Center]], [[Midtown, Houston, Texas|Midtown]], [[Greenway Plaza|Greenway&amp;nbsp;Plaza]], [[Memorial City]], [[Houston Energy Corridor|Energy&amp;nbsp;Corridor]], [[Westchase, Houston, Texas|Westchase]], and [[Greenspoint, Houston, Texas|Greenspoint]].

The districts are labeled A through K while the at-large positions are numbered 1 through 5.  

The city [[comptroller|controller]] is elected independently of the mayor and council. The controller's duties are to certify available funds prior to committing such funds and processing disbursements. The city's fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30.  [[Ronald C. Green|Ronald Green]] is the city controller, serving his first term as of January 2010.

As the result of a 1991 referendum in Houston, a mayor is elected for a two-year term, and can be elected to as many as three consecutive terms. The term limits were spearheaded by conservative political activist [[Clymer Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7397637.html|title=Aimee Buras, &quot;Clymer Wright, force for Houston term limits, found dead,&quot; January 25, 2011|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city controller and city council members are also subject to the same two-year, three-term limitations.

Houston is considered to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways between Republicans and Democrats. Much of the city's wealthier areas vote Republican, while the city's middle class, working class, and minority areas vote Democratic. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 68&amp;nbsp;percent of non-Hispanic whites in Harris County are declared or favor Republicans while 89 percent of non-Hispanic blacks in the area are declared or favor Democrats.

In 2013, Houston was identified as the #1 U.S. city for job creation by the U.S. Bureau of Statistics after it was not only the first major city to regain all the jobs lost in the preceding economic downturn, but after the crash, more than two jobs were added for every one lost. Economist and vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership Patrick Jankowski attributed Houston's success to the ability of the region's real estate and energy industries to learn from historical mistakes. Furthermore, Jankowski stated that &quot;more than 100 foreign-owned companies relocated, expanded or started new businesses in Houston&quot; between 2008 and 2010, and this openness to  external business boosted job creation during a period when domestic demand was problematically low.&lt;ref name=&quot;One&quot; /&gt;

The primary network-affiliated television stations are [[KPRC-TV]] (NBC), [[KHOU-TV]] (CBS), [[KTRK-TV]] (ABC), and [[KRIV-TV]] (Fox). 

The Houston–Sugar Land–Baytown metropolitan area is served by one public television station and two public radio stations.  [[KUHT]] (''HoustonPBS'') is a [[Public Broadcast Service|PBS]] member station and is the first public television station in the United&amp;nbsp;States.  Houston Public Radio is listener-funded and comprises two [[NPR]] member stations: [[KUHF]] (''KUHF News'') and [[KUHA]] (''Classical 91.7''). KUHF is news/talk radio and KUHA is a classical music station.  The [[University of Houston System|University of Houston&amp;nbsp;System]] owns and holds broadcasting licenses to KUHT, KUHF, and KUHA.  The stations broadcast from the Melcher Center for Public Broadcasting, located on the campus of the [[University of Houston]].

Houston is served by the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', its only major daily newspaper with wide distribution. The Hearst Corporation, which owns and operates the ''Houston Chronicle'', bought the assets of the ''[[Houston Post]]''—its long-time rival and main competition—when ''Houston Post'' ceased operations in 1995. The ''Houston Post'' was owned by the family of former Lieutenant Governor [[Bill Hobby]] of Houston.

Houston has sports teams for every major professional league, except the [[National Hockey League]]. The city currently hosts three of the four major sports in the United States: The [[Houston Astros]] is an [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] expansion team formed in 1962 (as the Colt .45s until 1965), who made one [[World Series]] appearance ([[2005 World Series|2005]]), the [[Houston Rockets]], who was formed in 1967 in [[San Diego]] and relocated in 1971 (and have won 2 [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] Championships), and the [[Houston Texans]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]].

Houston has the NFL's first retractable-roof stadium, [[Reliant Stadium]] (home of the [[Houston Texans|Texans]]). Minute Maid Park is also a retractable-roof stadium. The Toyota Center also has the largest screen for an indoor arena in the world built to coincide with the arena's hosting of the [[2013 NBA All-Star Game]]. [[BBVA Compass Stadium]] is a soccer-specific stadium for the [[Houston Dynamo|Dynamo]], located in East Downtown ([[EaDo]]). In addition, [[Reliant Astrodome|Reliant&amp;nbsp;Astrodome]] was the first indoor stadium in the world, built in 1965.

Houston has hosted several major sports events: The [[1968 MLB All-Star Game]], the [[1989 NBA All-Star Game|1989]], [[2006 NBA All-Star Game|2006]] and [[2013 NBA All-Star Game]], [[Super Bowl VIII]] and [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], as well as hosting the [[2005 World Series]] and [[1981 NBA Finals|1981]], [[1986 NBA Finals|1986]], [[1994 NBA Finals|1994]] and [[1995 NBA Finals]], winning the latter two.  Super Bowl LI is currently slated to be hosted in Houston's Reliant Stadium in 2017.

Houston was home to the now defunct WNBA [[Houston Comets|Comets]] from 1997 to 2008. The Comets won 4 WNBA Championships (all consecutive) which is still the most championships of any sports team in Houston, and the biggest title streak in Texas. The AFL/NFL [[Houston Oilers|Oilers]] called Houston home from 1960 to 1997 when the team moved to Tennessee and became the [[Tennessee Titans|Titans]]. 

The city has hosted several major professional and college sporting events, including the annual  [[Shell Houston Open]] golf tournament.  Houston hosts the annual NCAA College Baseball Minute Maid Classic every February and NCAA football's [[Texas Bowl]] in December.

The Shell and Pennzoil [[Grand Prix of Houston]] is an annual [[auto racing|auto race]] on the [[IndyCar Series]] circuit.

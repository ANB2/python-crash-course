PURPOSE
=======

Covers commands you can use to interact with files and directories:

    $ cp
    $ mv
    $ rm
    $ rm -rf
    $ mkdir
    $ du
    $ grep
    $ find -iname
    $ chmod
    $ chown

INSTRUCTIONS
============

This directory contains a simple puzzle that will demonstrate your ability
to use basic shell commands to:

1. copy, move, and remove files and directories;
2. to create directories;
3. to determine the size of files;
4. to search for files by name;
5. to search for files by contents;
6. and to change ownership and permissions of files.

This is a very hands-off exercise.

There is a sub-directory for each of these tasks.

In that subdirectory, there will be three files:
1. README: contains the description of what we want to do
2. check: a shell script that you can run to check your work
3. solution: a shell script that you can view & run to solve the task
